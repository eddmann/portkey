Here is the updated technical product development guide using the product name Portkey ‚Äî a secure, developer-friendly, Go-based tunnel service. The guide is broken into clear, structured iterations designed for a team to build the product collaboratively, with each step having specific goals, deliverables, and tech decisions.

ü™Ñ Portkey ‚Äî Technical Product Development Guide

A secure, extensible, Go-based tunnel service for developers.

‚∏ª

üß≠ Product Vision

Portkey allows developers to securely expose their local development servers to the internet using encrypted tunnels, with full visibility, token-based access, and modern deployment tooling. Inspired by tools like LocalTunnel, Ngrok, and Expose ‚Äî Portkey is designed to be:
‚Ä¢ Written in Go (for performance, portability)
‚Ä¢ Self-hostable with Docker/Fargate support
‚Ä¢ Secured with token-based authentication
‚Ä¢ Enhanced with a real-time Web UI
‚Ä¢ Extensible with modern tunneling tech (QUIC, gRPC, etc.)

‚∏ª

üîÅ Iteration Plan

Each iteration below is designed to be independently achievable by a team. Epics, goals, deliverables, and ownership hints are included.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Iteration 1 ‚Äì Core Tunneling MVP

Goal: Build the basic tunnel architecture between portkey-client and portkey-server using WebSocket and subdomains.

Team Focus: Core Networking, Routing

Features
‚Ä¢ portkey-client:
‚Ä¢ CLI to expose a local port
‚Ä¢ Flags: --port, --server, --subdomain
‚Ä¢ Persistent WebSocket connection
‚Ä¢ portkey-server:
‚Ä¢ Accept WebSocket connections from clients
‚Ä¢ Map subdomain ‚Üí client
‚Ä¢ HTTP handler routes requests to correct tunnel

Deliverables
‚Ä¢ Functional tunnel between client and server
‚Ä¢ Requests to subdomain.portkey.dev reach localhost:PORT

Tech
‚Ä¢ Go net/http
‚Ä¢ Gorilla WebSocket
‚Ä¢ Basic subdomain registry
‚Ä¢ Dockerfile

‚∏ª

üîê Iteration 2 ‚Äì Token-Based Authentication & Authorization

Goal: Secure tunnel creation and limit access using tokens and subdomain scoping.

Team Focus: Auth, Token Handling

Features
‚Ä¢ Static auth.yaml file:

tokens:

- token: abc123
  subdomains: ["project1"]
  role: user
- token: admin456
  subdomains: ["*"]
  role: admin

  ‚Ä¢ Validate tokens on tunnel registration
  ‚Ä¢ Enforce subdomain restrictions
  ‚Ä¢ Role-based API access

Deliverables
‚Ä¢ Secure token enforcement in CLI and server
‚Ä¢ Token-injection via --auth-token
‚Ä¢ Middleware for auth/role enforcement

Tech
‚Ä¢ Go config parsing (yaml.v3)
‚Ä¢ Middleware for auth
‚Ä¢ Role-based struct for tokens

‚∏ª

üåê Iteration 3 ‚Äì Embedded Caddy for TLS and Proxy

Goal: Enable HTTPS out of the box using embedded Caddy.

Team Focus: Integration, DevOps

Features
‚Ä¢ Use embedded Caddy v2 inside portkey-server
‚Ä¢ Auto TLS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt
‚Ä¢ Serve:
‚Ä¢ \*.portkey.dev ‚Üí tunnel proxy
‚Ä¢ /ui, /api ‚Üí Web UI + API
‚Ä¢ Serve static UI files via Caddy

Deliverables
‚Ä¢ Server binary with embedded Caddy
‚Ä¢ HTTPS works automatically
‚Ä¢ CLI flags: --https, --domain, --caddy-email

Tech
‚Ä¢ Caddy Go module
‚Ä¢ Internal route adapters
‚Ä¢ Let‚Äôs Encrypt integration

‚∏ª

üìä Iteration 4 ‚Äì Web UI + Real-Time Request Logging

Goal: Visualize tunnel traffic and enable debugging for developers.

Team Focus: UI/UX, Observability, Backend API

Features
‚Ä¢ In-memory log store for HTTP requests
‚Ä¢ WebSocket /api/ws for live logs
‚Ä¢ REST APIs:
‚Ä¢ GET /api/requests
‚Ä¢ GET /api/tunnels
‚Ä¢ GET /api/requests/:id
‚Ä¢ UI SPA (React/Vue)
‚Ä¢ Live stream
‚Ä¢ History viewer
‚Ä¢ Request detail view

Deliverables
‚Ä¢ Web UI served at /ui
‚Ä¢ Token-protected UI (admin role)
‚Ä¢ CLI flag: --enable-web-ui, --log-store=memory

Tech
‚Ä¢ Go REST API + Gorilla WebSocket
‚Ä¢ React/Vue + Tailwind
‚Ä¢ Circular buffer log storage

‚∏ª

‚òÅÔ∏è Iteration 5 ‚Äì Docker & AWS Deployments

Goal: Simplify deployment with Docker and Fargate/EC2 readiness.

Team Focus: DevOps, Infrastructure

Features
‚Ä¢ Hardened Dockerfiles for portkey-server and portkey-client
‚Ä¢ ECS Fargate task definition
‚Ä¢ EC2 systemd/Docker install docs
‚Ä¢ Docker Compose for local dev

Deliverables
‚Ä¢ Public Docker images
‚Ä¢ Sample ECS/EC2 deployment templates
‚Ä¢ ECR/Fargate setup guide

Tech
‚Ä¢ Docker, AWS CLI
‚Ä¢ Terraform or CloudFormation templates
‚Ä¢ Systemd service for EC2

‚∏ª

üìÇ Iteration 6 ‚Äì Persistent Request Logging & Replay

Goal: Store and replay past requests, helpful for debugging webhooks.

Team Focus: Storage, Developer Experience

Features
‚Ä¢ SQLite-backed log store
‚Ä¢ Replay HTTP requests to active tunnels
‚Ä¢ Optional: download logs as JSON
‚Ä¢ CLI flag: --log-store=sqlite
